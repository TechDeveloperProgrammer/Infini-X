# Infini-X Core - Authentication Package

This directory contains the core authentication and authorization logic for the Infini-X system. It provides functionalities for user login, session management, token handling, and access control.

## Purpose
- **Secure User Access**: Manages user authentication against various identity providers or internal databases.
- **Authorization**: Defines and enforces access policies to different resources and functionalities.
- **Session Management**: Handles user sessions, including creation, validation, and termination.
- **Extensibility**: Designed to support different authentication mechanisms (e.g., username/password, OAuth, API keys).

## Structure (Conceptual)
- `auth.go`: Contains core authentication functions (e.g., `AuthenticateUser`, `ValidateToken`).
- `middleware.go`: Middleware for protecting API endpoints.
- `models.go`: Data structures for users, roles, and permissions.
- `providers/`: Subdirectory for different authentication providers (e.g., `local.go`, `oauth.go`).

## Usage
Components within the Infini-X monorepo that require user authentication or authorization should import and utilize functions from this package. For example, a web server would use `auth.AuthenticateUser` for login and `auth.AuthMiddleware` to protect routes.

## Further Development
- Implement robust password hashing and storage mechanisms.
- Integrate with external identity providers (e.g., Google, GitHub).
- Develop a comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system.
- Add support for multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Implement rate limiting and brute-force protection for authentication endpoints.
