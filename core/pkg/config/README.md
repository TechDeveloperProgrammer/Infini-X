# Infini-X Core - Configuration Package

This directory contains utilities for loading, parsing, and managing configurations across the Infini-X system. It provides a structured way to access application settings from various sources (e.g., YAML files, environment variables).

## Purpose
- **Centralized Configuration**: Provides a single source of truth for application settings.
- **Environment-Specific Settings**: Allows for easy switching between development, staging, and production configurations.
- **Type-Safe Access**: Ensures that configuration values are accessed in a type-safe manner.
- **Reloading**: Supports dynamic reloading of configurations without restarting the application.

## Structure (Conceptual)
- `config.go`: Contains functions for loading and parsing configuration files (e.g., `LoadConfig`, `GetSetting`).
- `models.go`: Defines Go structs that map to the configuration structure (e.g., `AppConfig`).
- `sources/`: Subdirectory for different configuration sources (e.g., `yaml.go`, `env.go`).

## Usage
Applications and services within Infini-X should use this package to load their runtime configurations. This promotes consistency and reduces boilerplate code for configuration management.

## Further Development
- Implement support for more configuration formats (e.g., JSON, TOML).
- Integrate with a distributed configuration system (e.g., Consul, etcd).
- Add validation for configuration values.
- Implement a mechanism for overriding configuration settings via command-line arguments.
