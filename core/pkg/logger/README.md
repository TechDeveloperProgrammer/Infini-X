# Infini-X Core - Logger Package

This directory contains the centralized logging utilities for the Infini-X system. It provides a consistent interface for logging messages across different components, with support for various log levels and output destinations.

## Purpose
- **Unified Logging**: Ensures all components log messages in a consistent format.
- **Configurable Output**: Allows directing logs to different destinations (e.g., console, file, remote logging service).
- **Log Levels**: Supports different severity levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) for fine-grained control over log verbosity.
- **Structured Logging**: (Future) Support for structured logging (e.g., JSON format) for easier parsing and analysis.

## Structure (Conceptual)
- `logger.go`: Contains functions for initializing the logger and logging messages at different levels (e.g., `SetupLogger`, `Info`, `Error`).
- `hooks/`: Subdirectory for custom logging hooks (e.g., for sending logs to a remote service).

## Usage
All Go-based applications and services within Infini-X should use this package for logging. This ensures that logs are collected and formatted consistently, making debugging and monitoring easier.

## Further Development
- Integrate with a more advanced logging library (e.g., Zap, Logrus) for better performance and features.
- Implement support for structured logging (e.g., JSON format).
- Add support for remote logging destinations (e.g., Elasticsearch, Splunk).
- Implement log rotation and archiving.
