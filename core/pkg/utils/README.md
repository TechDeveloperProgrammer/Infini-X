# Infini-X Core - Utilities Package

This directory contains general-purpose utility functions and helper methods that are reusable across various components of the Infini-X core. These functions are typically small, stateless, and perform common tasks that don't belong to a specific domain.

## Purpose
- **Code Reusability**: Avoids duplicating common logic across different packages.
- **Simplification**: Provides convenient functions for frequently performed operations.
- **Modularity**: Keeps the core codebase clean by separating utility functions.

## Structure (Conceptual)
- `utils.go`: Contains various utility functions (e.g., `ReverseString`, `GenerateUUID`, `ParseTimestamp`).
- `validation.go`: Functions for data validation.
- `conversion.go`: Functions for data type conversions.

## Usage
Any Go package within the Infini-X monorepo can import and use functions from this utility package. This promotes a consistent approach to common tasks and reduces development time.

## Further Development
- Add more utility functions as common patterns emerge in the codebase.
- Ensure all utility functions are thoroughly tested.
- Document the purpose and usage of each utility function clearly.
