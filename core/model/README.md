# Infini-X Core - Data Models

This directory contains the shared data models (structs) used across various packages and services within the Infini-X core. These models define the structure of data exchanged between different components, ensuring consistency and type safety.

## Purpose
- **Data Consistency**: Provides a single, canonical definition for common data entities.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures that data is handled correctly throughout the application.
- **Modularity**: Decouples data structures from business logic, promoting cleaner code.
- **Serialization**: Facilitates easy serialization and deserialization of data (e.g., to JSON, YAML).

## Structure (Conceptual)
- `model.go`: Contains definitions for core data models (e.g., `User`, `Device`, `AIRequest`, `AIResponse`).
- `errors.go`: Custom error types used across the core.

## Usage
Any Go package or service within the Infini-X core that needs to represent or exchange data should import and use the models defined in this directory. This ensures that all components are working with the same understanding of the data.

## Further Development
- Add more data models as new entities are introduced into the system.
- Implement validation logic directly within the model structs (e.g., using struct tags).
- Consider using a code generation tool to automatically generate models from a schema definition (e.g., OpenAPI).
