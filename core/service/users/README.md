# Infini-X Core - User Service

This directory defines the service responsible for managing user accounts within the Infini-X system. It provides functionalities for user creation, retrieval, update, and deletion (CRUD operations).

## Purpose
- **User Management**: Centralizes all user-related operations.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures consistency and validity of user data.
- **Security**: Integrates with the `auth` package for secure user authentication and authorization.

## Structure (Conceptual)
- `users.go`: Contains functions for user CRUD operations (e.g., `GetUserByID`, `CreateUser`, `UpdateUser`, `DeleteUser`).
- `models.go`: Data structures representing users and their profiles.
- `store/`: Subdirectory for data storage implementations (e.g., `database.go`, `memory.go`).

## Usage
Other core services or external applications (e.g., `web/`) can use this service to manage user accounts. For example, the web interface could call `CreateUser` to register new users or `GetUserByID` to retrieve user profiles.

## Further Development
- Implement a persistent data storage solution (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite).
- Add support for user roles and permissions.
- Implement password reset and account recovery functionalities.
- Integrate with an email service for user notifications.
- Develop a robust validation system for user input.
