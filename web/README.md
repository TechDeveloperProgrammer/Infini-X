# Infini-X Web Application

This directory contains the web-based components of the Infini-X project. This could include a user interface for managing configurations, monitoring systems, or interacting with the AI functionalities.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React (JavaScript/TypeScript) with Bootstrap CSS, incorporating Material Design principles.
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation.
- **State Management**: Context API or Redux (conceptual).
- **Build Tool**: npm/yarn

## Structure
- `public/`: Static assets like `index.html`.
- `src/`: Source code for the React application.
  - `src/index.js`: Entry point for the React application.
  - `src/App.js`: Main application component, handles routing.
  - `src/components/`: Reusable UI components.
    - `src/components/Navbar.js`: Navigation bar.
  - `src/pages/`: Different views/pages of the application.
    - `src/pages/Dashboard.js`: Overview dashboard.
    - `src/pages/Users.js`: User management interface.
    - `src/pages/Devices.js`: Device management interface.
    - `src/pages/AI.js`: Interface for AI interactions.
  - `src/services/`: Client-side services for interacting with backend APIs (conceptual).
  - `src/context/`: React Context for global state management (conceptual).
- `package.json`: Node.js project configuration and dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

2.  **Start Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or yarn start
    ```
    This will typically open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

3.  **Build for Production**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or yarn build
    ```
    This will create a `build/` directory with optimized production assets.

## Further Development
- Implement actual UI components and functionalities for each page.
- Integrate with backend APIs (if any) using `src/services/`.
- Implement robust state management using React Context or Redux.
- Add comprehensive testing for UI components and integration.
- Enhance styling with more Material Design components and custom CSS.
