# Infini-X Web - Components

This directory contains reusable React components that are used across different pages and sections of the Infini-X web application. Components are designed to be modular, self-contained, and focused on presenting specific UI elements.

## Purpose
- **Reusability**: Avoids duplicating UI code by creating generic components that can be used in multiple places.
- **Maintainability**: Makes it easier to manage and update UI elements by centralizing their definitions.
- **Consistency**: Ensures a consistent look and feel across the application by using standardized components.
- **Testability**: Individual components can be easily tested in isolation.

## Structure (Conceptual)
- `Navbar.js`: The main navigation bar for the application.
- `Footer.js`: The application footer.
- `Sidebar.js`: A sidebar navigation component.
- `Card.js`: A generic card component for displaying content.
- `Button.js`: A custom button component.

## Usage
Components from this directory are imported and used within `pages/` or other components to build the application's user interface. They typically receive data as `props` and emit events (e.g., `onClick`) to their parent components.

## Further Development
- Create a comprehensive library of reusable UI components.
- Implement Storybook or a similar tool for component documentation and development.
- Ensure components are accessible (WCAG compliant).
- Optimize component rendering for performance.
