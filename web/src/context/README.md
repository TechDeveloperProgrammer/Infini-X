# Infini-X Web - Context

This directory contains React Context API implementations for managing global state within the Infini-X web application. Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

## Purpose
- **Global State Management**: Provides a centralized mechanism for managing application-wide state (e.g., theme, user authentication status, global notifications).
- **Avoid Prop Drilling**: Reduces the need to pass props through many levels of nested components.
- **Modularity**: Encapsulates related state and logic within a single context provider.

## Structure (Conceptual)
- `AppContext.js`: Provides a global context for application-wide settings (e.g., theme, language).
- `AuthContext.js`: Context for managing user authentication status and related data.
- `NotificationContext.js`: Context for displaying global notifications or alerts.

## Usage
Components that need to access or modify global state can consume the relevant context using the `useContext` hook. Context providers are typically wrapped around the root of the application or specific sections that require access to the shared state.

## Further Development
- Implement more complex global state management using `useReducer` or integrate with a dedicated state management library like Redux or Zustand for larger applications.
- Add more contexts for different global concerns as the application grows.
- Ensure proper memoization and optimization to prevent unnecessary re-renders when context values change.
