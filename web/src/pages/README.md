# Infini-X Web - Pages

This directory contains the main pages or views of the Infini-X web application. Each file typically represents a distinct route or section of the application and composes various components to form a complete UI.

## Purpose
- **Route Definitions**: Each page corresponds to a specific URL path in the application's routing.
- **Layout and Composition**: Pages are responsible for arranging and integrating reusable components to create a full view.
- **Data Fetching**: Pages often initiate data fetching from `services/` to populate their content.

## Structure (Conceptual)
- `Dashboard.js`: The main overview page, displaying key system information.
- `Users.js`: Page for managing user accounts.
- `Devices.js`: Page for managing connected devices.
- `AI.js`: Page for interacting with offline AI models.
- `Settings.js`: Page for application settings.

## Usage
Pages are rendered by the main `App.js` component based on the current URL using `react-router-dom`. They serve as the top-level containers for specific functionalities within the application.

## Further Development
- Implement full functionality for each page, integrating with backend services.
- Add loading states, error handling, and empty states for data fetching.
- Optimize page rendering for performance and user experience.
- Implement pagination, filtering, and sorting for data-heavy pages.
