# Infini-X Web - Services

This directory contains client-side services responsible for interacting with backend APIs. These services abstract away the details of making HTTP requests, providing a clean interface for pages and components to fetch and send data.

## Purpose
- **API Abstraction**: Centralizes API call logic, making it easier to manage and update API endpoints.
- **Data Fetching**: Handles communication with the backend, including request formatting and response parsing.
- **Error Handling**: Provides a consistent way to handle API errors.
- **Reusability**: Services can be used by multiple components or pages that need to interact with the same backend resources.

## Structure (Conceptual)
- `api.js`: Contains functions for making API calls related to users, devices, and AI interactions.
- `auth.js`: Functions for authentication-related API calls (login, logout, token refresh).

## Usage
Pages and components import functions from these services to interact with the Infini-X backend. This separates data fetching logic from UI rendering logic, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

## Further Development
- Implement actual API calls using `fetch` or a library like `axios`.
- Add robust error handling, including retry mechanisms and user-friendly error messages.
- Implement request and response interceptors for common tasks like adding authentication headers.
- Integrate with a state management solution to cache API responses and reduce redundant requests.
