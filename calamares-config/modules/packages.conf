# Calamares Packages Module Configuration

--- # YAML header

# This module typically relies on the packages installed by the base system
# or additional packages specified in the Calamares configuration.
# For Arch, it usually means pacstrap is run by the `fstab` module.
# No specific configuration needed here for a basic setup, as packages are defined in ArchISO profile.

# Optional: Add additional packages to install (beyond those in the ISO profile)
# installPackages:
#     - "firefox"
#     - "vlc"

# Optional: Remove packages after installation
# removePackages:
#     - "nano"
