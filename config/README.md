# Infini-X General Configurations

This directory serves as a central location for general project-wide configurations that do not fit into more specific categories like `dotfiles/`, `calamares-config/`, or `platforms/`.

## Purpose
- **Global settings**: Configuration files that apply across multiple components or modules of the Infini-X project.
- **Shared resources**: Common configuration templates or default values.
- **Environment variables**: Definitions or examples for environment variables used by the project.

## Structure
- `common.yaml`: A general configuration file for shared settings, often in YAML format.
- `logging.yaml`: Configuration for logging across different services and applications.
- `env.example`: An example file for environment variables, to be copied and customized by developers.
- `README.md`: This file.

## `common.yaml`
This file would contain settings that are common to many parts of the Infini-X system. Examples include API endpoints, default timeouts, or feature flags.

## `logging.yaml`
Defines the logging configuration for various applications within the monorepo. This could include log levels, output formats, and destinations (e.g., console, file, remote service).

## `env.example`
Provides a template for environment variables that need to be set for development or deployment. Developers would copy this to `.env` (or similar) and fill in sensitive information or specific paths.

## Usage
Components within the Infini-X monorepo should load their configurations from these files, prioritizing more specific configurations (e.g., module-specific configs) over general ones. This allows for a flexible and hierarchical configuration system.

## Further Development
- Populate with actual configuration values as the project evolves.
- Implement a robust configuration loading mechanism in relevant codebases (e.g., Go, Python, Node.js).
- Document each configuration parameter and its impact.
