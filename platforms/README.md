# Infini-X Platforms

This directory is intended to house platform-specific configurations, scripts, and code. In a monorepo supporting diverse environments (e.g., different CPU architectures, cloud providers, or specialized hardware), this structure helps in organizing and managing platform-dependent assets.

## Purpose
- **Architecture-specific optimizations**: Code or configurations tailored for `x86_64`, `arm64`, etc.
- **Environment-specific deployments**: Configurations for cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure), on-premise, or edge deployments.
- **Hardware-specific drivers/firmware**: If Infini-X were to interact directly with specialized hardware.

## Structure
- `x86_64/`: Configurations and scripts optimized for x86_64 architecture.
  - `x86_64/kernel-configs/`: Kernel configuration files specific to x86_64.
  - `x86_64/drivers/`: Placeholder for x86_64 specific drivers.
- `arm64/`: Configurations and scripts optimized for ARM64 architecture.
  - `arm64/kernel-configs/`: Kernel configuration files specific to arm64.
  - `arm64/drivers/`: Placeholder for arm64 specific drivers.
- `cloud/`: Cloud-specific deployment configurations.
  - `cloud/aws/`: AWS-specific configurations (e.g., CloudFormation, Terraform).
  - `cloud/gcp/`: GCP-specific configurations.
- `edge/`: Configurations for edge devices.
  - `edge/rpi/`: Raspberry Pi specific configurations.

## Usage
When developing or deploying components of Infini-X, refer to the relevant subdirectory within `platforms/` for any platform-specific instructions or files. Build systems (like the `Makefile`) would typically use these configurations to produce platform-optimized binaries or deployments.

## Further Development
- Populate subdirectories with actual platform-specific files (e.g., optimized kernel configurations, specific driver binaries).
- Implement build system logic to conditionally include platform-specific assets based on the target architecture or environment.
- Define clear interfaces for platform-dependent modules to ensure seamless integration with the `core/` logic.
- Add automated testing for platform-specific builds.
