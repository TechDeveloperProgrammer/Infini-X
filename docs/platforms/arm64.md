# ARM64 Platform Specifics

This document details the configurations and considerations specific to the ARM64 (AArch64) architecture within the Infini-X monorepo.

## Overview

ARM64 is an increasingly important architecture, especially for embedded systems, single-board computers (like Raspberry Pi), and mobile devices. Infini-X aims to provide robust support for ARM64, enabling deployment on a wider range of hardware.

## Key Areas

### 1. Kernel Configurations (`platforms/arm64/kernel-configs/`)

This directory contains `.config` files used for building custom Linux kernels optimized for ARM64 systems. Tailoring the kernel for ARM64 involves:

-   **Performance**: Enabling specific ARM CPU optimizations, disabling unnecessary modules.
-   **Hardware Support**: Including drivers for specific ARM64 hardware components (e.g., various SoCs, peripherals).
-   **Power Management**: Optimizing for power efficiency, crucial for mobile and embedded devices.

**Example**: `default.config` would be a baseline kernel configuration for ARM64.

### 2. Drivers (`platforms/arm64/drivers/`)

This directory is a placeholder for ARM64 specific drivers that might be required for particular hardware. This could include:

-   Drivers for specialized ARM SoCs.
-   GPU drivers for embedded graphics.
-   Custom peripheral drivers.

### 3. Build System Integration

The `Makefile` and other build scripts need to be configured for cross-compilation when building for ARM64 from an x86_64 host, or for native compilation on an ARM64 host. This involves using appropriate ARM64 toolchains and flags.

### 4. ArchISO (Conceptual)

While the primary ArchISO build is for x86_64, conceptually, a separate ArchISO profile could be created for ARM64. This would involve:

-   An ARM64-specific `profiledef.sh`.
-   `packages.arm64` and `packages.arm64.add` lists.
-   ARM64-compatible bootloader configurations.

### 5. Android GSI (`build-rom/`)

The Android GSI build scripts (`build-rom/make_gsi.sh`) support building GSIs for ARM64 Android targets. The `build-rom/config/gsi_build.conf` file allows specifying `TARGET_ARCH="arm64"`.

### 6. Containerization

Docker, Podman, WayDroid, and LXC generally support ARM64 architectures. Specific configurations in `containers/` might be needed for ARM64-specific optimizations or hardware interactions.

## Further Development

-   **Comprehensive ARM64 Support**: Fully implement and test builds for various ARM64 platforms (e.g., Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, ARM-based servers).
-   **Cross-Compilation Toolchains**: Set up and document cross-compilation environments for building ARM64 binaries from x86_64.
-   **Performance Benchmarking**: Conduct detailed performance benchmarks on different ARM64 hardware to identify and implement further optimizations.
-   **Hardware Compatibility List**: Maintain a list of compatible ARM64 hardware components and their specific configurations.
