# Platforms Overview

This section provides an overview of the platform-specific configurations and code within Infini-X. Our monorepo is designed to be adaptable, allowing for tailored optimizations and deployments across various hardware architectures and environments.

## Philosophy

-   **Adaptability**: Infini-X aims to run efficiently on different CPU architectures (x86_64, ARM64) and deployment contexts (local, cloud, edge).
-   **Optimization**: Platform-specific directories allow for fine-tuning components (e.g., kernel configurations, drivers) to maximize performance and compatibility on target hardware.
-   **Modularity**: Separates platform-dependent code from core logic, making the system easier to maintain and extend.

## Structure

The `platforms/` directory is organized by target environment:

-   **`x86_64/`**: Contains configurations and scripts specifically optimized for the x86_64 architecture.
    -   `kernel-configs/`: Kernel configuration files (e.g., `.config` files for custom kernel builds).
    -   `drivers/`: Placeholder for x86_64 specific drivers or driver configurations.

-   **`arm64/`**: Contains configurations and scripts specifically optimized for the ARM64 architecture.
    -   `kernel-configs/`: Kernel configuration files for ARM64.
    -   `drivers/`: Placeholder for ARM64 specific drivers.

-   **`cloud/`**: Houses configurations and deployment scripts for cloud environments.
    -   `aws/`: AWS-specific configurations (e.g., CloudFormation templates, Terraform files).
    -   `gcp/`: GCP-specific configurations (e.g., Deployment Manager templates, Terraform files).

-   **`edge/`**: Contains configurations and optimizations for edge devices.
    -   `rpi/`: Raspberry Pi specific configurations (e.g., boot settings, device tree overlays).
    -   [Learn more about Edge platform specifics](platforms/edge.md)

## Usage

When building or deploying components of Infini-X, the build system (e.g., `Makefile`) would typically reference these platform-specific directories to include the correct configurations or binaries for the target environment. This ensures that the final system is optimized for its intended platform.

For example, when building an ArchISO for x86_64, the `build-iso` process might pull kernel configurations from `platforms/x86_64/kernel-configs/`.

## Further Development

-   **Populate with Actual Configurations**: Fill each platform directory with concrete, tested configuration files and scripts.
-   **Automated Builds**: Implement robust build system logic to automatically select and apply platform-specific assets during the build process.
-   **Cross-Compilation**: Set up cross-compilation toolchains for building components for different architectures.
-   **Deployment Automation**: Develop comprehensive deployment scripts for cloud and edge environments.
-   **Performance Benchmarking**: Conduct performance benchmarks on different platforms to identify and implement further optimizations.
